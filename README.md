# Swift & Objective-C Protocols

This is a demo project for [the video](https://yakovmanshin.com/2025/03/swift-and-objective-c-protocols/) about the similarities, differences, and efficient use of Swift and Objective-C protocols.

You’ll find different stages of the project in separate branches.

## Tasks
* [x] Create a starter project
* [x] Implement the Objective-C protocol (`StringManipulatorProtocol`) in the Swift object (`StringManipulator`)
* [x] Fix the crash that occurs when the non-implemented optional method is called
* [ ] Replace `WordProcessor` with a Swift version and use the better way to handle the optional method
* [ ] Declare the `WordProcessorDelegate` protocol in Swift and implement it in Objective-C (`ViewController`)
* [ ] Mark the protocol’s methods as `optional` and remove the unneeded method implementations
